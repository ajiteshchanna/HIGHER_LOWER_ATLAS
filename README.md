# HIGHER_LOWER_ATLAS

Welcome to the Higher Lower Atlas, which is a console-based game where players have to guess which of the two displayed countries has a higher population. It offers an engaging and educational experience with fun. The game is based on the very famous higher lower game combined with our favourite childhood atlas game, this time taking population as our main parameter.

Features:
  Console-based game interface for easy accessibility.
  Displays two randomly selected countries.
  Prompts the player to choose which country they believe has the higher population.
  Tracks the player's score throughout the game.
  Stores the highscore of the player along with his/her name in a seperate CSV file.

How to Play:
  Clone the repository to your local machine.
  Navigate to the project directory.
  Run the game using your preferred Python interpreter: python atlas_higher_lower.py
  Follow the prompts to make your guesses and see if you can beat your high score!

Game Logic:
  The game randomly selects two countries from a list of countries along with their populations.
  Players input their guess by typing 'A' or 'B' to indicate which country they think has the higher population.
  The game ends when the player makes an incorrect guess.
  The high score is updated and displayed at the end of each game session.
